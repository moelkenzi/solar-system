# Solar System Explorer - Performance Optimized

This is an optimized version of the Solar System Explorer CSS-only project. The optimizations focus on improving performance while maintaining all the original functionality and visual design.

## Performance Improvements

The following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Image Optimization**

   - Added width and height attributes to all images to prevent layout shifts
   - Added loading="lazy" attribute to defer loading of off-screen images
   - Converted HTTP URLs to HTTPS for security and performance
   - Reduced image sizes where possible

2. **CSS Optimization**

   - Created a minified version of the CSS (style.min.css)
   - Implemented font-display: swap for better text rendering during font loading
   - Preloaded critical assets like fonts and the largest contentful paint image

3. **HTML Optimization**

   - Added proper meta tags for SEO
   - Improved document title and description
   - Implemented preloading of critical resources
   - Added alt text to images for accessibility

4. **Resource Loading**
   - Added a lazy loading script for background images
   - Implemented font loading strategy to prevent invisible text
   - Used minified version of Font Awesome

## How to Use the Optimized Version

To use the optimized version:

1. Link to style.min.css instead of style.css in your HTML
2. Add the optimize.js script before the closing body tag
3. Make sure all images have proper width, height, and alt attributes

```html
<!-- Add this before </body> -->
<script src="optimize.js"></script>
```

## Performance Metrics

The optimizations address the following performance issues:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) reduction
- Properly sized images
- Efficient image formats
- Reduced render-blocking resources
- Optimized text compression
- Reduced unused CSS
- Proper image dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Efficient cache policy for static assets
- Visible text during webfont loading
